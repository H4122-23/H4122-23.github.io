# Web sémantique

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a web-based search engine for scientists using the Wikidata endpoint. The search engine will allow users to search for specific scientists and to access information about them. This include their name, nationality, field of research, and the works they are associated with. The results will be displayed in an organized manner, making it easier for users to find the information they need.

Project Requirements:
1. Access the Wikidata endpoint to obtain data about scientists.
2. Create a web-based search engine that allows users to search for specific scientists.
3. Display the results in a organized manner, including the scientist’s name, nationality, field of research, and the works they are associated with.
4. Allow users to filter the results by nationality, field of research, and/or works.
5. Deploy the search engine on a web server.

Project Timeline:
1. Research Wikidata endpoint and create a data model: 1 week
2. Create a web-based search engine: 2 weeks
3. Test and debug the search engine: 1 week
4. Deploy the search engine on a web server: 1 week
5. Continue to test and improve the search engine: ongoing.
